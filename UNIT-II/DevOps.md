  * Model-driven approach using a declarative language.
  * Ideal for managing large-scale infrastructures with consistent configurations.
* **DevOps Functionality**:

  * Enforces desired state configuration across environments.
  * Handles system configuration, software installation, and service management.

#### **Chef**

* **Role**: Uses a **Ruby-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language)** to write system configuration "recipes."
* **Strengths**:

  * Highly flexible and powerful for developers.
  * Excellent integration with version control and testing tools.
* **DevOps Functionality**:

  * Manages server setup and deployment automation.
  * Supports both on-prem and cloud environments.

#### **Ansible**

* **Role**: A **lightweight, agentless** automation tool that uses **YAML (Playbooks)**.
* **Strengths**:

  * Simple and human-readable.
  * Agentless – no need to install software on managed nodes.
* **DevOps Functionality**:

  * Suitable for **configuration management**, **application deployment**, and **orchestration**.
  * Supports **rolling updates**, **rollback**, and dynamic inventory.

> All three tools reduce manual errors, ensure consistency across environments, and support continuous integration and deployment — the core of DevOps practices.

### **4. A software development team is experiencing frequent delays in deploying new features. How can DevOps practices help streamline the development and deployment process?**

DevOps practices address **cultural, procedural, and technical barriers** that commonly cause deployment delays. Here's how:

#### **Key DevOps Benefits for Deployment Efficiency**:

| Problem Faced by Dev Team                | How DevOps Helps                                                                                            |
