### **4. Compare and contrast different Informatica Cloud services, such as Cloud Data Integration and Cloud Application Integration.**

**TLO:** 1
**Bloom’s Level:** L3
**PI Code:** 1.4.3

| Feature                  | Cloud Data Integration                                       | Cloud Application Integration                                                   |               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Primary Function**     | Batch and real-time data integration across various sources. | Real-time application integration and process automation.                       |               |
| **Use Cases**            | Data migration, data warehousing, and analytics.             | API management, event-driven processing, and orchestrating business workflows.  |               |
| **Integration Approach** | Focuses on data movement and transformation.                 | Emphasizes application connectivity and real-time data exchange.                |               |
| **Processing Mode**      | Supports both batch and real-time processing.                | Primarily real-time processing with support for asynchronous operations.        |               |
